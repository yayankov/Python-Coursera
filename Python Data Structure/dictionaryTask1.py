# Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt
# and figure out who has sent the greatest number of
# mail messages. The program looks for 'From ' lines and
# takes the second word of those lines as the person who
# sent the mail. The program creates a Python dictionary
# that maps the sender's mail address to a count of the number
# of times they appear in the file. After the dictionary is
# produced, the program reads through the dictionary using
# a maximum loop to find the most prolific committer.
